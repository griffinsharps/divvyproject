How many bikes, scooters, and docks are available in Chicago's Divvy bike system right now?
We can answer this question using Lyft's real-time [Divvy API](https://ride.divvybikes.com/system-data).

This project uses Python to fetch data from Divvy's station info [GBTS JSON feed](https://gbfs.divvybikes.com/gbfs/en/station_status.json) and count the number of bikes, scooters, and docks currently available.
